<h1 style="color:red;">Pertussis</h1>
<h2 style="color:black;">Whooping cough (pertussis) is a highly contagious respiratory tract infection. In many people, it's marked by a severe hacking cough followed by a high-pitched intake of breath that sounds like "whoop".<p>

<h2 style="color:blue;">Causes of Pertussis
<h3>Whooping cough (pertussis) is an infection of the respiratory system caused by Bordetella pertussis bacteria. It mainly affects babies younger than 6 months old who aren't yet fully protected by immunizations, and kids 11 to 18 years old whose immunity has started to fade.<p>

<h2 style="color:blue;">Incubation Period of Pertussis<p>
<p>
<h3>Typically, the incubation period of pertussis ranges from 3-12 days; it is a 6-week disease divided into catarrhal, paroxysmal, and convalescent stages, each lasting 1-2 weeks.<p>
<p>
<p>
<h2 style="color:blue;">Management for Pertussis<p>

<h3>• Recognition of complications and early referral for supportive care<p>
• Early antibiotic treatment to reduce transmission.<p>
• Educating and informing your patient about whooping cough.<p>
• Preventing transmission by keeping infectious patients home from childcare, school or work.<p>
• Managing contacts of infectious patients in collaboration with your public health unit.<p>

<h2 style="color:blue;">Stages of Whooping Cough<p>
<p>
<h3 style="color:red;">Stage 1: Catarrhal Phase<p>
<h3>•Coryza<p>
• Low-grade fever<p>
• Mild, occasional cough (which gradually becomes more severe)<p>
•Apnea (in infants)<p>
<p>
<p>
<h3 style="color:red;">Stage 2: Paroxysmal Phase<p>
<h3>• Paroxysms of numerous, rapid coughs due to difficulty expelling thick mucus from the tracheobronchial tree<p>
• Long inspiratory effort accompanied by a high-pitched “whoop” at the end of the<p>
•paroxysms<p>
• Cyanosis<p>
• Vomiting Exhaustion<p>
<p>
<p>
<h3 style="color:red;">Stage 3: Convalescent 
Characterized by:<p>
<h3> • Gradual recovery<p>
• Less persistent, paroxysmal coughs that disappear in 2-3 weeks<p>
<p>

<h2 style="color:blue;">Diagnostic Procedures for Whooping Cough

      
<h2 style="color:red;">•Chest radiography<p> 
<h3>Chest radiography may reveal perihilar infiltrates or edema with variable degrees of atelectasis. Consolidation is indicative of secondary bacterial infection or, rarely, pertussis pneumonia.
<h2 style="color:red;">•Cultures
<h3>The results of blood culture are uniformly negative because B pertussis grows solely in the respiratory epithelium; recovery rates are highest during the catarrhal or early paroxysmal phase and are low after the fourth week of illness. <p>
<h2 style="color:red;">•PCR Assay and ELISA
<h3>PCR assays and antigen detection are increasingly used to assist in diagnosing pertussis; advantages include greater sensitivity, more rapidly available results, and use later in the disease course; although this or a positive culture is the case definition for reporting pertussis to the CDC or the WHO, some are now recommending confirmation with ELISA before declaring an epidemic.
<h2 style="color:red;">•Throat Culture
<h3>Nose or throat culture. A simple swab of the area where your nose and throat meet can be tested for the bacteria that causes whooping cough.
